# CVX-optimisation-
The main report is found in Yuanda_z5383121.pdf. Convex optimisation and mathematical optimisation in general is a vast topic. I’ll try to
cover the theory of convex optimisation quickly without sacrificing too much rigour, and include
also a couple of applications. Much of this project is a summary of Professor Boyd’s book
on convex optimisation chapter 1-6.
